# Impairment classification using latent features in non-intrusive speech quality models

Authors: Fredrik Cumlin (fcumlin@gmail.com), Xinyu Liang (hopeliang990504@gmail.com)

This is the official implementation of latent distortion classification in non-intrusive speech quality assessment from the paper "Impairments are Clustered in Latents of Deep Neural Network-based Speech Quality Models".

## Download datasets

### LibriAugmented
The authors are unable to make the dataset open access due to licensing restrictions. Note that we have used [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/94/) as a clean speech dataset, and distorted the signals using augmentations from [audiomentations](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations).

### ESC-50 dataset
See https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50.

## Training and evaluation
We have made the codebase [gin configurable](https://github.com/google/gin-config), which is a lightweight configuration framework. See `configs/tot.gin` for an example. Example run:
```
python train.py --gin_path=configs/tot.gin --save_dir=path/to/save_dir
```

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank our co-authors of the paper for great insights and discussions (without consideration of order): Victor Ungureanu (ungureanu@google.com), Chandan K.A. Reddy (chandanka@google.com), Christian Sch√ºldt (cschuldt@google.com), and Saikat Chatterjee (sach@kth.se).

We also would like to thank the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation for providing computational resources at the Berzelius cluster at the National Supercomputer Centre.
